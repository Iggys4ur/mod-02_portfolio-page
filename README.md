# [Module 2] Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## What I Learned From This Project
Creating a portfolio from scratch is essential for showcasing skills and talents to potential employers. This project provided practice in using flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables, which are vital for creating responsive and visually appealing web pages. Additionally, it reinforced the importance of having deployed web applications to enhance job search prospects.

# Project Overview
This project involves building a portfolio page that can be expanded as more projects are completed. It highlights the user's best work samples and demonstrates the thought processes behind them. This portfolio will serve as a critical tool during job searches, making a strong first impression on potential employers.

## Details
The project requirements were:

- **Implementing a responsive layout using flexbox and media queries**
- **Using CSS variables for consistency and maintainability**
- **Creating a visually appealing design to showcase web applications**
- **Ensuring the portfolio is live with at least one deployed application**

### 1. User Story:

    AS AN employer
    I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
    SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

### 2. Acceptance Criteria:

    GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
    WHEN I load their portfolio
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    WHEN I am presented with the developer's work
    THEN I am presented with a section containing titled images of the developer's applications
    WHEN I click on an image in the portfolio
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application
    WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
